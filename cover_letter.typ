I'm reaching out about a position at SIEMENS. As a Computer Science student at Government College of Engineering Nagpur, I got really excited when I saw this opportunity - especially since it would let me work on products that help engineers build better hardware.

In my recent projects, I've worked extensively with many of the technologies you're looking for. At PolymathAI, where my most recent position was, I have been building full-stack applications using React and Node.js. I've also built several web applications from scratch, including AIKO and ARA, where I worked with PostgreSQL and implemented complex backend architectures. These projects taught me a lot about building scalable services and writing clean, reusable code.

What really draws me to SIEMENS is the chance to work on products that have real impact in the engineering world. I love tackling technical challenges and finding elegant solutions - something I've done repeatedly while leading development teams for our college tech fests. The fact that SIEMENS encourages innovation and provides opportunities to work with cutting-edge technology makes this opportunity particularly exciting for me.

I'm a quick learner and always eager to pick up new skills. Whether it's figuring out a tricky Docker configuration or optimizing database queries, I enjoy diving deep into technical problems. I also believe my experience collaborating with teams on various projects has prepared me well for working in your engineering team.

I'd love to talk more about how I can contribute to SIEMENS's mission. Thanks for considering my application!
