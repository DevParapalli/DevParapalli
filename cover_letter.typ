I'm reaching out about the Full Stack Engineer position at GSK. After reading through the job description, I got really excited about the work your Emerging Tech team is doing, especially in the AI and cloud space.

For the past few years, I've been working on projects that line up perfectly with what you're looking for. At AIKO, I built an AI-powered knowledge system from the ground up, working with everything from custom NLP pipelines to cloud infrastructure on AWS. I managed to cut response times by 85% - something I'm pretty proud of. I've also got solid experience with Azure and GCP, and I'm comfortable working with both Python and Java.

What really caught my eye about this role is the chance to work on cutting-edge AI projects like the Azure OpenAI plugins and AI Search framework. I love the challenge of turning complex requirements into practical solutions, and I've done quite a bit of this while developing ARA, where we had to make AI tools actually useful for real students. The fact that GSK is using these technologies to improve healthcare makes the work even more meaningful.

I'm the kind of developer who enjoys diving into new technologies and figuring things out independently.Over the course of my college, I've learned how to communicate technical concepts to different audiences and work effectively with diverse teams - skills that I think would be valuable in this position.

I'd love to chat more about how I could contribute to your team and learn from the innovative work you're doing at GSK. Thanks for considering my application.
