I am writing to express my strong interest in the Software Engineer II position within Akamai's Networks department. As a Computer Science student with extensive experience in software development and AI technologies, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Akamai's mission of powering and protecting life online.

My technical background aligns perfectly with your requirements. Through my internship at PolymathAI, I developed AI-powered web applications using the MERN stack and Next.js, improving content organization efficiency by 40%. I have hands-on experience with Python, React, and SQL databases, as demonstrated in my projects AIKO and ARA, where I engineered custom NLP pipelines and implemented scalable data storage systems using PostgreSQL. My experience with Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS, combined with my strong Linux background, positions me well to contribute to your network operations systems. Additionally, my role as Vice President of the Computer Science Student's Association has honed my ability to understand complex business needs and collaborate effectively with diverse teams.

I am particularly drawn to Akamai's commitment to solving challenging technical problems and creating innovative solutions. Your focus on distributed computing and edge technology aligns perfectly with my career aspirations in building scalable, high-performance systems. I am excited about the prospect of joining your team and contributing to the development of robust, scalable tools that help maintain Akamai's global platform.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my skills and enthusiasm can contribute to Akamai's continued success.
